## What does it do?

- [x] Add new Cards
- [x] View cards in a collective manner
- [x] Open Modal to create new card
- [x] Basic Testing
  - I know it was a must but I'm running out of time and have significantly less experience with tests so only added a few
- [x] Uses TypeScript
- [x] Uses SCSS
- [x] No UI framework
- [x] Modular code

## Scope for improvement?

- [ ] Carousel can be added as it was provided in design
- [ ] Testing needs a lot more work
- [ ] Need more time to test out the edge cases though I feel most have been handled
- [ ] We can randomize things while generating to improve the experience
- [ ] Some accessibility enhancements can also be done in the color palette and in some other places but needs more Testing

I had all of the above things in my plans but I couldn't manage to do it in the said time.
